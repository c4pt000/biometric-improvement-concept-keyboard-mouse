# lenovo-biometric-improvement-concept

* having the biometric sensor on the left and right click buttons of the mouse would improve ergonomic design and ease of use to send a biometric signal instead of  having to physically move the hand off of the mouse and placing a registered finger with the biometric software to the middle of the mouse while using the mouse for ease of use.
